"""
The :py:mod:`ml` contains a set of facilities for data analysis: it is structured in three main modules, one :mod:`ml.classification` where can be found functions for fitting and evaluating classifiers, one :mod:`ml.clusters` where can be found functions for fitting and evaluating clustering algorithms, :mod:`ml.datasets` contains functions to easily get the datasets described in :ref:`datasets` and :mod:`ml.visualization` where can be found functions for visualizing data and results. All the modules interface with :py:mod:`sklearn` and :py:mod:`pandas` modules.

This module is specific for analyzing data from the :ref:`datasets` module, instead of :mod:`audiohandler` which as been designed for represent audio data in any kind of applications.
